<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On April&nbsp;1, 2010, K-Tron International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (&#147;K-Tron&#148;), and Hillenbrand,
Inc., an Indiana corporation (&#147;Hillenbrand&#148;), consummated the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of January&nbsp;8, 2010, among
Hillenbrand, Krusher Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Hillenbrand (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and K-Tron. Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Office
of the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey, the merger of Merger Sub and K-Tron (the &#147;Merger&#148;) was
effective as of April&nbsp;1, 2010. At the effective time of the
Merger, all outstanding shares of common stock of K-Tron, par value $0.01 per share (the
&#147;Common Stock&#148;), except those shares owned directly or indirectly by K-Tron, Hillenbrand or Merger
Sub, converted into the right to receive $150.00 in cash per share, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the
effective time of the Merger (i)&nbsp;each outstanding stock option that was unexercised was cancelled,
entitling each former holder thereof to payment equal to the number of shares underlying such
option multiplied by the excess (if any) of $150.00 over the exercise price of such option, (ii)
each outstanding restricted stock unit award vested and was cancelled, entitling each former
holder thereof to payment equal to $150.00 multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock which
each such award would otherwise be convertible and (iii)&nbsp;each outstanding share of unvested
restricted stock vested and was converted into the right to receive a payment equal to $150.00
multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock which such unvested
restricted stock converted into.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The information provided in response to Item&nbsp;2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is
incorporated herein by reference. The total consideration paid by Hillenbrand for the outstanding
shares of Common Stock and equity awards was $435,200,820. The source of funds for the cash
consideration was primarily cash on hand and proceeds from debt financing. Upon the effective time
of the Merger, the Merger constituted a change of control of K-Tron, resulting in K-Tron becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Hillenbrand. There are no known arrangements which may at a subsequent
date result in a change of control of K-Tron.
