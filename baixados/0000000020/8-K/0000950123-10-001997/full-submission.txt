</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;8, 2010, K-Tron International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (&#147;K-Tron&#148;), Hillenbrand,
Inc., an Indiana corporation (&#147;Hillenbrand&#148;), and Krusher Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Hillenbrand (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
K-Tron, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and K-Tron shall be the
surviving corporation of the merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the consummation of the Merger, (i)&nbsp;K-Tron will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Hillenbrand and (ii)&nbsp;each share of K-Tron common stock will be converted into the right to receive
$150.00 in cash (as may be adjusted as described in the following paragraph, the &#147;Merger
Consideration&#148;). In addition, options to acquire K-Tron common stock, stock appreciation rights
for shares of K-Tron common stock, K-Tron restricted stock unit awards and shares of K-Tron
unvested restricted stock, in each case that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation
of the Merger, will be converted into the right to receive cash based on the Merger Consideration
and the formulas contained in the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the event (i)&nbsp;the closing has not occurred by April&nbsp;30, 2010 as a consequence of Hillenbrand&#146;s
inability to pay the Merger Consideration as of such date and (ii)&nbsp;K-Tron has satisfied all
conditions to closing to be performed or satisfied by it as of such date, the per share Merger
Consideration will be increased by $0.05 for each day from May&nbsp;1, 2010 through the date of closing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">K-Tron, Hillenbrand and Merger Sub have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in
the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants that (i)&nbsp;K-Tron will conduct its business
in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the
effective time of the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;subject to certain limited exceptions, that the Board of
Directors of K-Tron will recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by its shareholders and (iii)
K-Tron will not solicit alternative business combination transactions and will respond to proposals
regarding such alternative business combination transactions only in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The consummation of the Merger is subject to (i)&nbsp;receipt of the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of all votes cast at a special meeting of K-Tron shareholders to approve the Merger,
(ii)&nbsp;the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Merger, (iii)&nbsp;regulatory
clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and (iv)
other customary closing conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Hillenbrand and K-Tron and
further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances,
K-Tron may be required to pay Hillenbrand a termination fee of $12&nbsp;million. If the Merger
Agreement is terminated by Hillenbrand due to K-Tron&#146;s willful breach of the Merger Agreement at a
time when a competing takeover proposal for K-Tron is pending, K-Tron will be required to pay
Hillenbrand its documented reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
transaction, up to a maximum amount of $10&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the Merger, on January&nbsp;8, 2010, Hillenbrand entered into a voting agreement with

and executive officers of K-Tron, pursuant to which such individuals have agreed to vote their
shares of K-Tron stock in favor of the Merger (the &#147;Voting Agreement&#148;). Collectively, the
agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Cloues and the other directors and executive officers relates to approximately
10&nbsp;percent of K-Tron&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock. The Voting Agreement terminates upon
the earliest of (a)&nbsp;the effective time of the Merger or (b)&nbsp;the termination of the Merger
Agreement.

information regarding the terms of the agreement and is not intended to provide any other factual
information about Hillenbrand, K-Tron or Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and covenants
contained in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by
the contracting parties. Certain of the representations and warranties have been made for the
purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of
establishing these matters as facts. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of the Merger
Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (i)
are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter that the parties have exchanged,
(ii)&nbsp;were made only as of the date of such agreement or a prior, specified date, and (iii)&nbsp;in some
cases are subject to qualifications with respect to materiality, knowledge and/or other matters,
including standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that may differ from those
applicable to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent
information may or may not be fully reflected in Hillenbrand&#146;s or K-Tron&#146;s public disclosures.
Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or condition of Hillenbrand or K-Tron or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;8, 2010, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Board of
Directors of K-Tron approved an Amendment (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to the Rights Agreement, dated October
16, 2001, between K-Tron and American Stock Transfer &#038; Trust Company LLC, as rights agent (the
&#147;Rights Agreement&#148;). The Amendment, among other things, renders the Rights Agreement inapplicable
to the Merger, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. In addition, the
Amendment provides, among other things, that (i)&nbsp;neither Hillenbrand, Merger Sub nor any of their
affiliates will become an &#147;Acquiring Person&#148; or a &#147;Principal Party&#148; (as such terms are defined in
the Rights Agreement), (ii)&nbsp;a Stock Acquisition Date (as such term is defined in the Rights
Agreement) shall not be deemed to have occurred and (iii)&nbsp;a Distribution Date (as such term is
defined in the Rights Agreement) shall not be deemed to have occurred, in each case, as a result of
the announcement of the Merger, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, or the execution of the Merger Agreement, including without limitation, the entry into
or performance of the Voting Agreement. The Amendment also provides that the &#147;Expiration Date&#148; (as
such term is defined in the Rights
Agreement) for exercise of the &#147;Rights&#148; (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) will be

Sub (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Each of the
Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, in
the circumstances in which such Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, are payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Sub (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Each of the
Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, in

contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
